# Papaya CMS Project Skeleton

This is a project skeleton for your own [papayaCMS](http://www.papaya-cms.com) projects. It allows to use
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org) for project initialization.

```
composer create-project papaya/cms-project projectname
```

If you like to use the latest development versions use:

```
composer create-project papaya/cms-project projectname -s dev
```

## Modules

Adding additional module packages:

```
composer require papaya/module-domains
```

## Themes and Templates

Themes and templates can be composer packages, too.

```
composer require papaya/theme-dynamic
```

Theme package will have a dependency to the template package. You do not need
to require them manually. (But you can.)

### Templates inside the project

Templates are installed into the templates subdirectory. You can add a new
directory to your project and develop/maintain the template there.

### Themes inside the project

Theme are installed into the htdocs/papaya-themes subdirectory. You can add a new
directory to your project and develop/maintain the theme there.

## Phing build file

The Skeleton includes a build file for [Phing](http://www.phing.info). It uses
the `composer` and `git` commands so make sure they can be called.

### Define build properties

Copy the file `dist.build.properties` to `build.properties` and modify it. At the
moment it includes to options for database connections. One for the development
and one for the deployment.

### Initialize the configuration

Just call Phing in the project directory:

```
phing
```

### Export the project for deployment

As directory:

```
phing export-directory
```

As zip:

```
phing export-zip
```

As tar gzip:

```
phing export-tgz
```
